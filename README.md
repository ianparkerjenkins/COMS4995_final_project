# COMS4995_final_project
Medical imaging segmentation project for COMS4995 @ Columbia


In this submission I've included:
	A video.txt file that contains a link to my YouTube video
	The slides used to create the video 
	A written transcript of my voice track for the video 
	The ipynb containing the code for my project 
		The outputs of the cells should be up to date and this should run end to end 
		
	
The following files can be found hosted in my cloud bucket (https://storage.googleapis.com/ipj2103coms4995project2/):	
	Zip files for my split level datasets 
	Zip files for the checkpoints for each level model
	*** I tried zipping them with my courseworks submission but they were too large
	

Apologies for the audio in my video jumping from quiet to loud out of nowhere ...
	I do not have very good hardware to record with and could not fix this in post ... :( 
	I hope the transcript helps if anything is unclear
